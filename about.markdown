        Hey, my name's Dominic. I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'd like to say I have a huge passion for building stuff and tinkering, but sometimes I'm not sure if it's all just a procrastination mechanism to keep me from studying. My favourite projects are those that mix hardware, electronics, and software. Jack of all trades, master of none.

This website is intended to be a place to document my projects as well as some of the more interesting 'tidbits' I encounter. Although I've been doing this for a few years on various sites such as github, hackaday, hackster.io, and youtube, none of these offered a central location to share the things as I wanted.

If you have any questions, criticisms, or just want to say hi, you can contact me through the email button below.
