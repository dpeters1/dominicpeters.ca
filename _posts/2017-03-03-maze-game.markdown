A simple maze game that relies on OpenCV colour space filtering to track objects. Maze levels are generated and must be navigated by moving the object in front of the camera.

Developed at CU Hacking Hackathon at Carleton University.

To play, compile OpenCV 3.X.X with python 2.7 bindings. Object detection parameters are calibrated with `python Colour_Calibration.py` Game can then be played with `python cvMazeGame.py`
